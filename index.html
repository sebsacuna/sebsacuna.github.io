    <h1> Welcome to my personal website</h1>
    <h2>(just testing styling **from css file)</h2>

    <div id="presentation">
      From Chile to Norway. Civil Electrical Engineering from PUC, currently
       studying at UiT Troms√∏ my MSc.
    </div>

    <div>The 90s style is on purpose</div>
    <div>
      <p>This is my personal website, created for educational purposes</p>
      <p>My objective is to develop the website from scratch, adding more and
      more functionality while I learn new stuff. Among the stuff I would like
      to learn using this website:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>html</li>
        <li>css</li>
        <li>Git</li>
        <li>Flask</li>
      </ul>
  </div>
    <p>I would like also to use online visualization like Dash (which I already
    have implemented in the past) and hopefully, some Machine Learning.</p>
    <p>I hope to put some entries in order to remember stuff, or tricks to do stuff quicker</p>

    <p>This is my plan of work for this semester</p>
